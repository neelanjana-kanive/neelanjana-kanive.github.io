<h4 id="ad-objective-2">Ad objective #2</h4>
<p>To persuade people who don’t wear socks at home to wear socks by highlighting the benefits of wearing socks. And telling them why Happy Socks should be their first choice.</p>
<p><strong>A hundred problems, one solution. Sleep.</strong></p>
<p>A nap a day keeps the stress away. Taking tiny power naps during stressful days can make you more alert, more efficient, reduce stress, improve cognitive functioning and keeps your mind healthy.</p>
<p>But there are times when can’t really fall asleep. You want to take a nap but the nap doesn&rsquo;t want to take you. maybe it’s anxiety or maybe it’s the weather. You just can&rsquo;t seem to find a comfortable position. It&rsquo;s too hot or too cold.</p>
<p><em>Or maybe it’s your feet!</em></p>
<p>A study from 2007 revealed that adults who wore socks to bed fall asleep faster. Warming up the feet and hands makes the blood vessels dilate, a response that is called vasodilation. This releases heat through the skin and helps to lower core body temperature. This, in turn, sends a message to the brain that it is bedtime.</p>
<p>We can help. Happy Socks, a high-quality sock that combines unique designs and craftsmanship. A comfortable and colorful tool for spreading happiness. Nap in style.</p>
