He used to write letters to his sibling describing the love he felt for them and the warmth that they exuded. When one of his adored greyhound, Biche died he felt immense anguish.\n “I have had a domestic loss which has completely upset my philosophy. I confide all my frailties in you: I have lost Biche, and her death has reawoken in me the loss of all my friends, particularly of him who gave her to\nme. I was ashamed that a dog could so deeply affect my soul; but the sedentary life I lead and the faithfulness of this poor creature had so strongly\nattached me to her, her suffering so moved me, that, I confess, I am sad and\nafflicted. Does one have to be hard? Must one be insensitive? I believe that anyone capable of indifference towards a faithful animal is\nunable to be grateful towards an equal, and that, if one must choose, it is best\nto be too sensitive than too hard.”\nsource\n Dogs have been creeping into our hearts since the dark ages and have continued to do so, making them not only a man’s best friend but also the oldest one.\nAlthough dogs have been the first to establish companionship with humans, over many moons’ diverse animals such as horses, cows, pigs, birds, reptiles and even spiders have stepped up to take its place. While cats are an anomaly, form being worshiped by ancient Egyptians to dropping down the hierarchy ladder to common house pets.\nRecent studies have shown that petting dogs can act as a catalyst to stress reduction but have you ever wondered this still remains valid with other animals? Is it just petting? Does taking care of animals change one’s personality? Questions like such often seem to plague one’s mind but it isn’t given much heed to.\nMost families these days have pets at home with an exception of people living in apartment buildings, those who are allergic etc. Even if your parents were strictly against pets you’ve probably tried your best to pet a neighborhood cat by making subtle movements.\nAt times we see morality in them which certain human beings lack.\nGrowing up in a household with a pet can influence the development of a child and the whole atmosphere of the family. Kids are taught to be responsible at a young age towards their pets and those lacking human relationships sometimes use pets as substitutes, helping them overcome the issues that they may face from lack of social interactions. They also develop empathy and a more humane character later in life.\nAttachment to pets at early years can serve as a great benefactor to the quality of life the child may lead. These ties play an important role in the child’s social, emotional, and cognitive development and their mental health. Children are functioned to form attachment at infancy to equip survival. Pets form an affectional bond and may meet the prerequisites which are observed in human-human attachments.\nIn a fast-paced world, where parents struggle to find time to spend with their children, growing up with animals can be the best possible solution to despondence. But then again this might not always be the case, if children aren’t taught to love the animal and treat them with respect it could cause mayhem to the pet as well as the child in question. And there are other cases where kids intentionally harm small animals, studies have shown that this might be because the child is a victim of abuse or might possibly have witnessed abusive behavior and is simply mimicking it.\nWe often talk about the crazy cat lady down the street, a dwindling stereotype that identifies any woman with a cat as crazy. society is made to see cat owners as strange and weird but since the changing times people are beginning to understand that having cats as pets has nothing to do with gender or being crazy. Although there are a certain people who horde animals as a substitute to human relationship this is a severe psychological issue that has to be dealt with utmost care and sensitivity.\nNot growing up with animals doesn’t necessarily mean you’re an awful person but people who are unfledged around animals sometimes tend to care less.\nIt’s never too late, to care, to love, to give back. It doesn’t matter what age you’re or where you’re from, there will always be enough space in the world for you to emanate warmth into. You don’t necessarily have to go out of your way to buy exotic pets, you can just look around you and see tons of animals in need of help. Little acts of kindness can bring you peace of mind and a whole lot of sunshine to the one at the receiving end.\nAll I’m saying is that in this sometimes bleak ‘dog-eat-dog’ world we need to look out for one another. With all that’s happening in the world from the Australian bushfires to the Taal Volcanic eruption we need to try and take the weight off of the world by doing the needful. It doesn’t have to be anything drastic; you can start for with baby steps.\n","permalink":"neelanjana-kanive.github.io/blog/love-beyond-languag/","tags":["post"],"title":"Love beyond language"},{"categories":["gardening"],"contents":"COVID 19 hit us like a drunk driver and spread around the world, causing a global pandemic, before we could say knife. Most parts of the world is in quarantine and people aren’t prepared.\nYou’d think, how hard is it to stay at home watch television all day? But by now you’ve probably felt the repercussion of being stuck indoors with the same people all day without having to talk to different people. The perks of being able to watch telly all day or being on the internet all day doesn’t seem all that perky at all. Separation from loved ones, the loss of freedom, uncertainty over disease status, and boredom can cause irritation and anxiety within oneself, and being stuck in one place with the same people doesn’t help ease this.\nIt is important to keep your mind and body occupied. Being stuck alone with your own thoughts can be very self-harming. It can cause overthinking and panic within oneself. Doing whatever you can to vivify your surrounding is important to keep your thoughts in order.\nI live with my parents, and over the past weeks, I’ve noticed that we all have our own way of keeping ourselves occupied. Although the first few weeks were pretty stormy for all of us, the disrupt in the normal routine, changes in sleeping patterns, and the constant stressful thoughts from watching the news, we powered through by doing things that helped us adjust. My dad restored to reading and yoga. My mom has started dedicating more time to gardening and making up new recipes. I, on the other hand, had adjusted to my new routine which basically involved sleeping all day and staying up all night. This was clearly unhealthy, so I decided to change it and follow my mom around for a few days and discover her secret to keeping herself cool, calm, and collected.\nI must admit standing in the morning sun and watering the plants for hours was refreshing. It felt like a different realm. One where my mom was the highest-ranking guardian. She explained to me how shes been caring for some of her plants for years, and the joy that brought her when they bloomed, was enigmatic. Being out in the green helps reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. There’s a term called green bathing also known as \u0026quot;shinrin-yoku\u0026quot; by the Japanese. It literally translates\nto forest bathing. It helps you reconnect with nature by enhancing your senses. This definitely explains how my mom was able to keep her cool during the major part of this quarantine.\nI did decide to take responsibility for a few potted plants, my one and only duty was to make sure they got enough water and sunlight. Not too much, not too little. The sunlight part was pretty much handled since my mom had already found a cozy place for them to stay alive. So I just had to remember to go water them at a fixed time. This really helped me form a connection with the outside world which wasn’t over the internet. Being responsible for the three plants that were bestowed upon me really made me feel productive. Baby steps, guys. I went from sleeping at 4 am and waking up for lunch to trying to fix my sleep schedule so I could be up on time to water my plant children, and the rest of the garden sometimes.\nI also noticed the different types of birds that flocked around the garden when the water hose was on. The heat was unbearable which forced the little birds to overcome their fears of humans to get a few minutes to soak itself in the garden water. If you stayed out long enough, you’d notice the different flocks of birds that arrived at their own fixed timings for, what they consider, tiny drops of heaven of leaves and flowers. Its almost like they had their own system. There are the colorful ones, there are the loud ones, the chirpy ones and the brave ones. The dogs have made their peace with it. They were all at the mercy of the scorching sun, hence came to an agreement that the sun was the common enemy so they weren’t meant to harm each other.\nDuring a time like this, there’s a lot of room for self-improvement, productivity, and time to learn something new. But it isn’t really essential to force yourself to be productive. All the motivational tales and the posts about how much people have achieved during this time can be damaging. Such comments may make people feel guilty about themselves and make them wallow in self-hate for not being able to do the things that others can. It’s okay to not always be on the move all the time. The world is taking a pause so take one for yourself.\n","permalink":"neelanjana-kanive.github.io/blog/week-x-quarantine/","tags":["post"],"title":"Week X of quarantine"}]
