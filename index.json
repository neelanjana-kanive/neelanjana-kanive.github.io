[{"categories":null,"contents":"To understand arguments made by philosophers about private property we must first have some abstract knowledge as to what private property entails and its origins. Several theories and ideologies, dating back to 428 BC, on private property have been proposed. The idea of private property has changed over time, from Plato to Karl Marx. Private property generally meant land ownership in the early 17th century, but the concept grew vaster as the times changed and legal aspects were introduced. To put it simply private property is a system of rules that grants the holder a form of authority over an asset. It is a bundle of rights that allows access and control of material resources (Waldron, 1985). This material resource can satisfy some human need or want. It does not just include the right to control over this asset but also claim to the value it generates, the right to exclude others from claiming it, and the right to transfer these bundles of rights to another. An alternative way to look at it is, the rights that regulate the relationship between the owner of the property and other people. Hence private property not only involves external physical objects but also the relationship between people. This essentially means that you do not have absolute right over property and there exists limitations. Holders of private property includes individuals, groups of individuals, organizations, or the state. Property can also be tangible, such as land or intangible, such as intellectual property or corporate stocks (Mueller et al, 2012).\nUsually when discussing about private property rights people categorize them into the communist perspective where property is owned by the state and the capitalistic perspective where property is owned by the individual. Several philosophers have argued favouring each of these perspectives. You cannot really downsize the idea of private property since it is a vast subject so let’s only look at it in the form of owning land.\nExamining the different political philosophers view on private property Plato and Aristotle Plato in his book The Republic writes about his political theory on structure of ownership. He wrote The Republic during the Greek wars, inspired by the spartan form of government which did not allow the concentration of wealth in the hands of the elite. In his ideal political model, he rejects private property. Instead he believed that the concept of private property created division in the Athenian democracy and strife in political decision making. He argued that collective ownership was necessary to promote common pursuit of the common interest, and to avoid the alienation that would occur when people are affected differently from the same happenings. In his ideal state the “guardians” ruled over the citizens and were not allowed to own property because he believed that property and virtue were incompatible. They were expected to live communally. Aristotle disagreed with his idea and said that private ownership would promote a sense of responsibility and prudence. He regarded property to bring about a positive force in the society. He opposed Plato’s idea of common property by saying that no one would take responsibility over property that is not theirs. Private property was something that evoked generosity in men and encouraged them to get on a higher ethical level (R. Pipes, 1999).\nThomas Hobbes (1588 – 1679) Thomas Hobbes’ concept of property is based on consent rather than natural law. In his philosophy the state came before the society. He ridiculed the idea of birth right and private inheritance and said that such liberties must be consented by the state to the individuals. The sovereign authority is absolute. Private property is the creation of the king and therefore he has the power to claim it without the handlers consent and avail taxes on it. In his book Leviathan he describes “right to property solely with the power to take possession over things and protect them from being taken by others property” (D.C Mueller et al, 2012, p.290)\nJames Harrington (1611 – 1677) James Harrington was the first “political theorist to view political power as a by-product of economics, or, more specifically, of the distribution of property between the state and the population.” (R. pipes, 1999, p.43). He believed in natural aristocracy and distribution of land among all individuals in the state. Power was reciprocal to property.\nJohn Locke (1632 – 1704): John Locke’s Two Treatises of Government was seen as a regression for the political idea of property. His idea of property was based on natural law rather than political philosophy. He looked at property as a god given asset common to all men and hence deems private property to be morally wrong. “With the development of trade and the invention of money came greed and discord. People then surrendered their unbridled freedom and equality for the sake of security of their persons and possessions: thus, the state came into being” (Locke, 1689 as cited by Pipes, 1999, p.46). Locke believed that the notion of property comes into existence when an individual applies labour on an object that did not belong to anyone.\n The Labour of his Body, and the Work of his Hands, we may say, are properly his. Whatsoever, then, he removes out of the State that Nature hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his Labour with, and joyned to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his Property (Locke, 1689 as cited by pipes, 1999, p.46)\n However, Locke’s theory would contradict the capitalistic perspective since the working class usually do not gain the fruits of their labour when compared to the property owners. This doesn’t necessarily mean that his theory had a communist agenda since it didn’t allow the king to have any authority or rights over the land that the citizens had laboured on.\nKarl Marx (1818–1883) and Friedrich Engels (1820–1895) They saw private property as a major impediment to welfare maximization. Marx acknowledged Locke’s theory that just measurement of personal labour prevails. “Marx recognised that john Locke’s theories were not an affirmative theory of capitalist private property. Instead he emphasised the importance of Locke’s conceptions to subsequent political economy” (J. Gronow, 2016, p.234). Marx and Engels agreed with the Lockean view that every man holds a claim to the value of his labour. When land and capital are owned by a few (individuals/ corporations) deprives workers of their labour value. This would lead to conflicts between the property-owning class and the working class. “The classless utopia envisioned by Marx and Engels hence had to be a society free of private property” (D.C Mueller et al, 2012, p.291)\nD. Hegel and William Blackstone They both believed in the absolutist concept of property. Hegel believes that property involves the relationship of a man to a thing.\n A person has the right to direct his will upon any object, as his real and positive end. The object thus becomes his. As it has no end in itself, it receives its meaning and soul from his will. Mankind has the absolute right of appropriation over all things. (F.S Cohen, 1954, p.6)\n According to Hegel property rights were important for “development and maintenance of capacities and self-understandings that make up free personality” (A. patten as cited by S. Duncan, 2017) And Blackstone refers to property as the \u0026ldquo;sole and despotic dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world, in total exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe.” (F.S Cohen, 1954, p.6) Rudolf Von Jhering ridiculed the Blackstonian definition of property stating that an absolute right of property would result in the dissolution of society (Cohen, 1954).\nAdam smith (1723- 1790) Adam Smith, in The Wealth of Nations wrote relatively little about the importance of private property when compared to the other topics he discussed. According to Heitger he took the importance of property rights for economic development for granted (2003). Smith was a follower of john Locke, but his theories contrasted to that of Locke’s. Jeffrey T. Young reviews smiths theory and concludes that “property itself refers to the things owned, but the concept of ownership itself and the conventions by which a thing becomes property ultimately rest on subjective opinions of the agents involved. Thus, judgments about property are based on habits that arise as people observe how their fellows behave toward such things as the fruits of their labour” (2008)\nCapitalism and private property Dennis Mueller defines the “feature of capitalism as the means of production—capitalistic production—are in the hands of private individuals and firms” (D.C Mueller et al, 2012, p.16).The existence of free market economy is one of the main attributes of capitalism. In a true capitalistic economy, the state is not involved in factors such as setting prices or restricting the flow of finance. (Mueller et al, 2012). The only time the state can intervene is when there is a negative impact on the economy, the state can commission large scale projects, such as major highways or new airports, and kick-start the economy (Holmes, 2009) Communism and private property\nThere are several versions of communism but one thing that can be stated is that a communist society abolishes private property. Although we can define the base from one of the major contributors to communistic ideology, Karl Marx. He lived during the era of industrial revolution. Marxism describes a classless, stateless utopia where everyone has everything in abundance. This ideal communist economic system was not seen in practical use and was only described in theory. In communistic economies, seen so far, leaving the pricing decisions to the market was seen as anarchy, hence there was no free market. In Communist states, most factories, banks, and other forms of enterprise were owned by the state. Communists called this social ownership of the means of production (Holmes, 2009).\nThere is no doubt that some of the political philosophies regarding private property may seem idealistic and flawless in theory, but in practice there will be several variables and situations that these political philosophies cannot resolve. Capitalistic nations usually have a higher wealth gap, the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer. Although communism tackles this by eliminating the concept of private ownership, it has its own flaws. It does not encourage competition hence leaves little room for innovation. This form of economic system has failed in several cases, for example the USSR. Even though china is run by the Communist Party of China, it is not true communism. It has incorporated strands of capitalistic policies to remain as a world superpower. Hence it does not matter really matter what becomes of private property rights until the state and the people can exist in harmony.\nBibliography\nCohen, F.

This impression has evolved throughout the duration of my course. The ground reality remained unchanged, but I’ve come to realise and understand that advertising is a part of a bigger whole, that is marketing. The advertisers confront challenging questions like, how will this information be delivered? to whom will it be delivered? and even predict how the delivered message will affect the targeted audience. These aspects which I’ve learnt during the 3 years have been cultivated for many years and still rapidly developing.\nThis makes you wonder when the power of advertising was recognised. It is evident that the art of persuasion and different forms of promotion dates to at least 200 years, the reason being that there were goods to sell and a medium to talk them up. Harvesting attention for commercial purpose gained sudden popularity from the 1890s to the 1920s. The first recorded newspaper ad, 1849, was about a new method of measuring your head to find the perfect hat size. Such content was not treated as advertising but as a form of news since it was considered interesting to readers. (Mark Tungate, 2013). Through the course of the industrial revolution, the ad business took off. Literacy rates rose which prompted businesses to invest more in, what we now call, classified adverts. In 1848 the first ad agency was established in Philadelphia, by Volney Palmer. Although the J. Walter Thompson agency formed in 1864 holds the title of the oldest ad agency that is still in existence (Moriarty et. Al, 2015, p.43). Professionalism in the field rapidly began to take shape and positions of account executive, planners, art directors and copywriters, and concepts of brand names and brand identity were created. The early 20 th century saw a rise in the popularity of scientific research techniques. The blend of art and science massively improved the effectiveness of advertising. Advertising then became something born out of strategic thinking that sought out to make consumers aware of a brand, company, or organization and influence them to do something.\nNow with the digital medium a dialogue, from what used to be one-way communication, has been established between the consumers and the producers. The constant innovations in new media have aided businesspeople to expand their markets and reach new people. With the introduction of social media, there have been massive changes in the way that companies communicate and interact with their target audience. As the medium develops companies need to change the ways they market their products and services to stay in the limelight.\nThe framework of advertising involves concepts of strategy, message, media, evaluation and much more. These concepts cannot be summarised since each has a subdivision of its own which are too important to skim through. As Sam Hill stated, “advertising is rocket science” (Shimp, 2007, p. 238), it is a complex activity that is unpredictable and has factors that are constantly shifting. One little miscalculation and the millions of dollars put into creating the ad will become nothing more than a bathroom break during intermission.\nFast-forward to the present day, we’ve seen thousands, maybe millions of commercial messages. Some are subtle and some in your face. According to Friestad and Wright 1994, 1995 (cited by Dahleiz \u0026amp; Edenius, 2012) people began to construct mental short-cuts called the advertising schema to deal with the massive number of ads being displayed. This is an internalised system that we as consumers have developed to interpret advertisements as persuasive messages. Therefore, it automatically makes us suspicious of advertisements. It is observed that ads that activate this schema have reduced recall. Increasing research has been conducted since to figure out how this schema is activated and the development of new media acts as changing factors to the studies. It\nwas also noted that traditional advertising shows increased activation of the advertising schema and the non-traditional advertisements was perceived to have less persuasive intent. This is because in traditional advertising, the messages conveyed are largely nonpersonal messages. However, with the introduction of more interactive medium the non personal characteristics are being eliminated. In other words, advertisers need to keep up with the new medium and surroundings to not grow stale and seem repetitive. WOM, word of mouth is one such technique where the communication happens between business to consumer to consumer which recognises the importance of personal communication. They need to enhance the effectiveness of their messages by placing them in new surroundings and pay close heed to the message designed (Dahleiz \u0026amp; Edenius, 2012). People like content, people consume content that they enjoy but when content comes in the form of adverts, they show a dislike towards that piece of content hence they need to be discreet. Consequently, advertisers are faced with the pressure of coming up with creative, that is to say, original, different, novel and unexpected ways to capture attention and increase recall.\nCreating an effective advertisement is not a walk in the park. It involves a lot of people working together towards a common goal, which could be brand awareness, increasing sales, repositioning etc. The copywriters, the art directors and the creative directors are in charge of coming up with the big idea, which includes the creative concept and crafting the execution idea. The copywriters handle the copy, the art director oversees the designs, and the creative directors manage the creative process. As Karen Mallia states in her book, creative truths (quoted by Moriarty et. al, 2015, p.242) “great work now takes a village—not just one or two geniuses” hence the rate of success will depend on the teamwork of the key players.\nThe copywriter’s horizon has expanded over time, in the past they used to only work for advertising agencies but now they work in all kinds of creative industries. They’ve gone from writing for print to writing for television, radio and digital platforms while also working for corporate communication and other fields beyond advertising. Their primary objective is to capture attention and put the message across. “The job of a copywriter is to use the right words to say the right things to the right people to get the right response. The process of identifying, improving, and capturing ideas is the dynamic behind copywriting, and hence they make a real contribution to the creative process” (Horberry, 2009, p.6). Their job description also involves bringing ideas to life. To simply put it, they take fragments of thoughts and give them meaning. They are very much involved in the process of coming up with the big idea, also known as the creative concepts. This big idea is then used as the central theme of the advertising campaign.\nThe creative process is inspired by a good brief. It specifies the basic elements of the creative strategy. This document goes by different names such as a creative platform or work plan, creative blueprint, or creative contract. It will act as a source of reference throughout the process. Information on strategy and positioning, objectives along other things like consumer benefits and mandataries will be mentioned. This brief is written collaboratively by the client and the agency planner where the client provides all the inputs from their side and the planner sets a guardrail for the creative process. The team does not get these ideas instantly, the creative process begins with briefing, research and several other brainstorming sessions that will eventually lead up to the finished product. During these brainstorming sessions, the team must explore all kinds of possibilities, they must talk about it, think about it, question it, position it, brand it, place it in a relevant or an irrelevant setting, let it stand alone, compare it to the competition, show before-and- after pictures, and twist it or bend it in as many ways as possible. This will then finally lead them to somewhat of a rough draft with many more steps to the finish line.\nCopywriting is the foundation that the ad is built on. It is also essential that the copywriter and the art director remain on the same page to avoid confusion, in a sense one cannot work without the other. As stated earlier the copywriter must produce the copy based on the ideas collected from the brainstorming sessions. The visual element then completes the copy element. ‘Once the creative direction is decided upon the copywriter determines what needs to be said, how much copy will it take to say it, the tone and style appropriate to project the concept and how to adapt that copy to a particular medium” (Blakeman, 2014).\nThen again you wonder, what counts as creative? Is an advert that brings in high sales considered creative or something, as stated before, original, different, novel, and unexpected considered creative? A successful advert is the combined efforts of both the creative department and the marketing department. If creative efforts fail, it is because the marketing plan failed. The public is bound to have different perceptions about ads but if the targeted audience considers it creative and brand recall is established, it can be recognised as a successful and creative Ad campaign. Therefore, it is important to know your audience and plan accordingly. Several studies have been conducted showing that various stages of the response hierarchy including cognitive, affective, and behavioural responses in consumers are impacted by advertising creativity (belch, 2012, p.264).\nA marketing plan includes the 4-Ps that is the marketing mix. The marketing mix consists of the four Ps, i.e., price, placement, product, and promotions. Advertising is greatly involved in the promotional communication. Besides advertising, the promotional mix also includes public relations, direct marketing and sales promotion, out-of-home and transit, the Internet and social media, mobile media, and alternative media. Everything delt in this mix ensures the communication happens in such a way that the target audience gets the right message.\nIntegrated marketing communications has seen a rise in popularity in recent years. IMC is when marketers use various marketing tools to propagate their messages. The idea is to release consistent promotional activities/messages such as media advertisements, price, package design, direct- marketing efforts, publicity, sales promotions, websites, point-of-purchase and displays, to build a synthesised perception of a brand in the mind of the consumer. They even make sure the type of store where a product or service is sold fits the image of the brand that is being built (belch, 2012, p.9). All the activities and messages in an IMC plan leads to a bigger picture, they all have one unifying message and image and talks to a specific audience. The IMC approach starts with the customer. They begin with the customer and work back to the brand. “The Marketers learn about what media customers use, the relevance of their message to the customers, and when customers and prospects are most receptive to the message” (Arnes 2010). It focuses on long term goals that build brand image and brand equity and works toward building a brand-loyal consumer. The advertising plan is a natural extension of the marketing plan. In addition to marketing communication, advertising also has a role in the functioning of the economy and society, especially in places where the supply exceeds demand. In such economies advertising roles extends to create demand for brands. It also serves other social needs than just promoting sales. For years it has been both applauded and criticized not only for its role in selling products but also for its influence on the economy and on society (Arnes 2010).\nAdvertising has come a long way, from being something as simple as talking up a product to being part of Integrated Marketed Communication. It is more than just selling a product/service, it acts as a catalyst to build brand identity, A way to communicate with a company’s consumers, mould a trusting relationship with them and much more. It holds the power to incite various emotions through different appeals and strategies. In short, Advertising has had a pronounced effect on society as well as the economy by fostering social attitudes and laws.\nReferences\nArens, C., Weigold, M.

Personally, two of the most dreadful things I have experienced until now is public speaking and taking my boards.\nGoogling ‘how not to be nervous’ every time I face difficult situations has become a habit. Hence, I have taken it upon myself to list out a few of my favourite methods that works best for me.\nBreathing out of the several articles that I have read so for breathing is the most common and effective method of all. Taking a minute to myself and practising shallow breathing really helps me get my jitters to a lower level.\nThe sympathetic nervous system i.e. fight or flight response and the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for rest and relax, cannot be active at the same time. Breathing signals the digestive system to calm down and the co2 entering the blood due to this helps quite the brain.\nI really wish I had given more thought to this method because the number of times I have thrown up before a major exam is insane.\nExercise energy is always conserved. It can never be diminished; it can only be changed from one form to another. Exercise helps convert the nervous energy to heat and helps you let out steam and relax.\nA few years ago, I had to perform on stage for a skit in front of my whole batch. I was a train wreck. I ran back and forth from my classroom to the staging area, a couple of times, before I could perform my act. This really helped release the endorphins (runners high) in me. It made me less conscious of myself.\nChallenge your thoughts what’s the worst that could happen? Try reasoning with yourself. Ask yourself is it likely to happen?\nMy 12th grade math exam was my worst nightmare. I could hear my heartbeat in my head. I kept thinking what would happen if I failed and I couldn’t concentrate. At some point I started to calm down because I started to think about what would really happen if I failed and I realised its not a big deal hence proceeded to calmly pass the exam.\nChanging focus when people say don’t think about it, try listening to them. Overthinking will cause more butterflies in your lungs.\nI doodle one books and much on candies to deter my attention from the stress. This eventually led me to develop better drawing skills but also got me cavities.\nThe placebo effect believing in yourself. Fake it till you make it. This may sound cheesy, but it works. the only person who can carry you is yourself, again, this sounds too tacky and kind of cringe but if you believe that you are all you need, you will get to places in life.\nThis doesn’t mean you shouldn’t ask for help; it never hurts to have other people believe in you too.\n","permalink":"https://neelanjana-kanive.github.io/blog/chaotic-nerves/","tags":["post"],"title":"Guide to chaotic nerves"},{"categories":["copywriting"],"contents":"Happy Socks is a Swedish manufacturer and retailer of socks, underwear, and swimwear.

He used to write letters to his sibling describing the love he felt for them and the warmth that they exuded. When one of his adored greyhound, Biche died he felt immense anguish.\n “I have had a domestic loss which has completely upset my philosophy. I confide all my frailties in you: I have lost Biche, and her death has reawoken in me the loss of all my friends, particularly of him who gave her to\nme. I was ashamed that a dog could so deeply affect my soul; but the sedentary life I lead and the faithfulness of this poor creature had so strongly\nattached me to her, her suffering so moved me, that, I confess, I am sad and\nafflicted. Does one have to be hard? Must one be insensitive? I believe that anyone capable of indifference towards a faithful animal is\nunable to be grateful towards an equal, and that, if one must choose, it is best\nto be too sensitive than too hard.”\nsource\n Dogs have been creeping into our hearts since the dark ages and have continued to do so, making them not only a man’s best friend but also the oldest one.\nAlthough dogs have been the first to establish companionship with humans, over many moons’ diverse animals such as horses, cows, pigs, birds, reptiles and even spiders have stepped up to take its place. While cats are an anomaly, form being worshiped by ancient Egyptians to dropping down the hierarchy ladder to common house pets.\nRecent studies have shown that petting dogs can act as a catalyst to stress reduction but have you ever wondered this still remains valid with other animals? Is it just petting? Does taking care of animals change one’s personality? Questions like such often seem to plague one’s mind but it isn’t given much heed to.\nMost families these days have pets at home with an exception of people living in apartment buildings, those who are allergic etc. Even if your parents were strictly against pets you’ve probably tried your best to pet a neighborhood cat by making subtle movements.\nAt times we see morality in them which certain human beings lack.\nGrowing up in a household with a pet can influence the development of a child and the whole atmosphere of the family. Kids are taught to be responsible at a young age towards their pets and those lacking human relationships sometimes use pets as substitutes, helping them overcome the issues that they may face from lack of social interactions. They also develop empathy and a more humane character later in life.\nAttachment to pets at early years can serve as a great benefactor to the quality of life the child may lead. These ties play an important role in the child’s social, emotional, and cognitive development and their mental health. Children are functioned to form attachment at infancy to equip survival. Pets form an affectional bond and may meet the prerequisites which are observed in human-human attachments.\nIn a fast-paced world, where parents struggle to find time to spend with their children, growing up with animals can be the best possible solution to despondence. But then again this might not always be the case, if children aren’t taught to love the animal and treat them with respect it could cause mayhem to the pet as well as the child in question. And there are other cases where kids intentionally harm small animals, studies have shown that this might be because the child is a victim of abuse or might possibly have witnessed abusive behavior and is simply mimicking it.\nWe often talk about the crazy cat lady down the street, a dwindling stereotype that identifies any woman with a cat as crazy. society is made to see cat owners as strange and weird but since the changing times people are beginning to understand that having cats as pets has nothing to do with gender or being crazy. Although there are a certain people who horde animals as a substitute to human relationship this is a severe psychological issue that has to be dealt with utmost care and sensitivity.\nNot growing up with animals doesn’t necessarily mean you’re an awful person but people who are unfledged around animals sometimes tend to care less.\nIt’s never too late, to care, to love, to give back. It doesn’t matter what age you’re or where you’re from, there will always be enough space in the world for you to emanate warmth into. You don’t necessarily have to go out of your way to buy exotic pets, you can just look around you and see tons of animals in need of help. Little acts of kindness can bring you peace of mind and a whole lot of sunshine to the one at the receiving end.\nAll I’m saying is that in this sometimes bleak ‘dog-eat-dog’ world we need to look out for one another. With all that’s happening in the world from the Australian bushfires to the Taal Volcanic eruption we need to try and take the weight off of the world by doing the needful. It doesn’t have to be anything drastic; you can start for with baby steps.\n","permalink":"https://neelanjana-kanive.github.io/blog/love-beyond-languag/","tags":["post"],"title":"Love beyond language"},{"categories":["gardening"],"contents":"COVID 19 hit us like a drunk driver and spread around the world, causing a global pandemic, before we could say knife. Most parts of the world is in quarantine and people aren’t prepared.\nYou’d think, how hard is it to stay at home watch television all day? But by now you’ve probably felt the repercussion of being stuck indoors with the same people all day without having to talk to different people. The perks of being able to watch telly all day or being on the internet all day doesn’t seem all that perky at all. Separation from loved ones, the loss of freedom, uncertainty over disease status, and boredom can cause irritation and anxiety within oneself, and being stuck in one place with the same people doesn’t help ease this.\nIt is important to keep your mind and body occupied. Being stuck alone with your own thoughts can be very self-harming. It can cause overthinking and panic within oneself. Doing whatever you can to vivify your surrounding is important to keep your thoughts in order.\nI live with my parents, and over the past weeks, I’ve noticed that we all have our own way of keeping ourselves occupied. Although the first few weeks were pretty stormy for all of us, the disrupt in the normal routine, changes in sleeping patterns, and the constant stressful thoughts from watching the news, we powered through by doing things that helped us adjust. My dad restored to reading and yoga. My mom has started dedicating more time to gardening and making up new recipes. I, on the other hand, had adjusted to my new routine which basically involved sleeping all day and staying up all night. This was clearly unhealthy, so I decided to change it and follow my mom around for a few days and discover her secret to keeping herself cool, calm, and collected.\nI must admit standing in the morning sun and watering the plants for hours was refreshing. It felt like a different realm. One where my mom was the highest-ranking guardian. She explained to me how shes been caring for some of her plants for years, and the joy that brought her when they bloomed, was enigmatic. Being out in the green helps reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. There’s a term called green bathing also known as \u0026quot;shinrin-yoku\u0026quot; by the Japanese. It literally translates\nto forest bathing. It helps you reconnect with nature by enhancing your senses. This definitely explains how my mom was able to keep her cool during the major part of this quarantine.\nI did decide to take responsibility for a few potted plants, my one and only duty was to make sure they got enough water and sunlight. Not too much, not too little. The sunlight part was pretty much handled since my mom had already found a cozy place for them to stay alive. So I just had to remember to go water them at a fixed time. This really helped me form a connection with the outside world which wasn’t over the internet. Being responsible for the three plants that were bestowed upon me really made me feel productive. Baby steps, guys. I went from sleeping at 4 am and waking up for lunch to trying to fix my sleep schedule so I could be up on time to water my plant children, and the rest of the garden sometimes.\nI also noticed the different types of birds that flocked around the garden when the water hose was on. The heat was unbearable which forced the little birds to overcome their fears of humans to get a few minutes to soak itself in the garden water. If you stayed out long enough, you’d notice the different flocks of birds that arrived at their own fixed timings for, what they consider, tiny drops of heaven of leaves and flowers. Its almost like they had their own system. There are the colorful ones, there are the loud ones, the chirpy ones and the brave ones. The dogs have made their peace with it. They were all at the mercy of the scorching sun, hence came to an agreement that the sun was the common enemy so they weren’t meant to harm each other.\nDuring a time like this, there’s a lot of room for self-improvement, productivity, and time to learn something new. But it isn’t really essential to force yourself to be productive. All the motivational tales and the posts about how much people have achieved during this time can be damaging. Such comments may make people feel guilty about themselves and make them wallow in self-hate for not being able to do the things that others can. It’s okay to not always be on the move all the time. The world is taking a pause so take one for yourself.\n","permalink":"https://neelanjana-kanive.github.io/blog/week-x-quarantine/","tags":["post"],"title":"Week X of quarantine"}]
